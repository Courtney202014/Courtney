                                           THE MOM SHE NEVER LOVED!!!!
       
          
          I woke up to the smell of pancakes and the sizzling sounds of bacon. I went down stairs and saw my family at the
          table I grabbed a plate and went to the table. I talked to my family and then when I was done I went to the living
          room and watched TV. Two hours later my dad went to work then I did something bad and my mom was so mean she threatened to cut my fingers off and beat me with a belt. I would cry and cry and tell her I did not hit my sister but she
          never believes me. She always believes my other sisters being in a family of eight there was always trouble in that house. 
          Then there was a knock at the door so I opened the door there stood a tall man in a black suite I said hello sir. He
          reached for my hand to shake and I recoiled. He said settle down I just want a handshake. I yelled for my mom. She
          looked around the corner and said coming. She ran toward the door and went on the porch. I could hear her crying and
          screaming and she was saying something about us kids and there no way. He told her something about you have 4 days.
          She come in the house and told the older three were going to our grandma's and the younger three were going to
          someone else houses. She told us we were going to be there for a while until she can get us back and we asked her why
          and she would scream at us she told us lies our entire life and know she telling us to tell another one. The cops
          would interview us at school for the next three days then on the fourth day they came to our house and told us we
          were going to new homes we cried so much but that was because we never left our home we still never loved her and she
          did not know it. 
                Being at our grandma's not knowing where my sisters were got to me and made me cry everyday. Don't get me wrong our grandma was great and she was more like our mom.  We always got new clothes, Toys, and always got to play on the computer
                
                Then boom out of no were we moving again. 
               This time I was moving to some house in a small town just me and my older sister the other three had already been in like nine homes. Two went to my step-dad's cousin's house and the other two went somewhere in another small house.
               These people I went to were so mean they were big and scary and yelled at us. They made us do everything. Four
               months later the other two from that small town came and lived with us the lady we lived with beat the younger
               boy every time he cried or did something bad. Then they saw bruises and blamed it on the oldest she got in
               trouble for something she never did. So she moved  with the other two and me and my other two sister and brother
               lived with the rude mean lady. We did not tell anyone because we were afraid. Eventually are mom told someone
               and then some guy add to talk to us so we talked to him. Then we were all taken away from her and we moved to my
               step-father's cousin's house. Now we are all together again.
              
AND SHE LEARNED THAT SHE NEVER EVEN LOVED HER OWN MOM!!!!!!!
